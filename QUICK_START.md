## Your Neon Database is Ready! âœ…

Your Neon database connection is already configured:
```
postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_aou72AyCpdRN@ep-dawn-forest-ad77y081-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment (Optional for testing)
The database is ready, but you'll need Cloudinary for image uploads:

1. **Get Cloudinary credentials** from https://cloudinary.com
2. **Update `server/config.env`** with your Cloudinary details:
   ```env
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key  
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

### 3. Create Admin User
```bash
node server/create-admin.js
```
This creates an admin with:
- **Email**: admin@saree.com
- **Password**: admin123

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Access Your Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
