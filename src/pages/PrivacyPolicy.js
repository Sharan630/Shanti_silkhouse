In some cases, they might collect information directly from you (e.g., for a research survey). In such instances, you will be notified of their involvement, and any information you disclose will be strictly optional. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements regarding the information we supply. If you provide additional information directly to them, their privacy policy will govern its use. We encourage you to review their practices before providing information.
